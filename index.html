                    <p>My family is my everything. They are my motivation and my support system. I enjoy spending my time with them. My family is always in my corner good or bad. But the two people who are most special to me are my mom, Tiffianay, and my little sister, Trinity.</p>
                    <p>My mom, Tiffianay, in my opinion is one of the most oustanding women on this earth. She is there when ever and where ever I need or my siblings need her. Not only does she excel as a mother, but also as an educator. My mom dedicaates every once of herself to her family, students, and church. Also she just so happens to be what I aspire to be A STRONG (mentally, physically, and spiritually) strong woman!</p>
                    <p>Trinity, my little sister, is one of my best friends. She is also my biggest source of motivation. We enjoy bonding thru music and dancing. I do my best to continuesly encourage her and be the role model she wants to look up to. We also bond thru fashion. I am a fashionista, diva, and superstar all wrapped in one, and I try to teach her to be the same. I teach her that being those things are not just about appearances but personality, mentality and morality. I guide my sister to best of my abilities because when I look at her I see me. A pre-teen who has so much to offer the world, but yet afraid to let it shine. I push Trinity to chase her dreams and give her all to what she wants. Now as I sit here typing this, I realize she is teaching me a lot as well and helping me to become a ambitious young woman. </p>

                    <p>Poetry and music are my past time. I have been writing poetry since I was around the tinder age of 10 years and music since around 15 years of age. When I write my poetry or music I listen to my heart and what is around me. It allows me to express myself fully without having to tame my words. I feel free to be me with no judgement or crucification about why I'm me. Poetry and music are my escape from pain. It also allows me to give a voice to those who don't or those who are afraid to use theirs. </p>
                    <p>I am currently learning to play the acoustic guitar. My plan is to, once I've fully learned the guitar, is to travel around the city and share my stories. Whether it be on a street corner, in a church, or at an open mic nite i will share my pain, happiness, trials, and tribulations to help someone else thru theirs. My goal with my music and poetry is to just uplift and encourage everyone.</p>
